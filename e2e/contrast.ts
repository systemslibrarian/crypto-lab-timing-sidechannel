/**
 * Composite-aware WCAG 1.4.3 contrast measurement.
 *
 * This exists because axe is not a complete contrast oracle. Two classes of
 * text never reach the `violations` array a gate asserts on:
 *
 *  - text over a surface axe declines to resolve — a gradient, an `rgba()` over
 *    an unknown backdrop, or a `color-mix()`. Almost every surface that carries
 *    MEANING in this lab is one or the other. The three verdict tones
 *    (`.verdict--leak`, `.verdict--safe`, `.verdict--inconclusive`) are
 *    `color-mix(in srgb, …, var(--panel))`; so are the three status pills
 *    (`.bad`, `.good`, `.warn`), both proof-card columns (`.proves`,
 *    `.disproves`), every character of the reveal diff (`.ch.ok`, `.ch.bad`),
 *    the winning candidate chip (`.why-top li.win`), the tinted board rows
 *    (`.board-leak`, `.board-safe`), every `code` background, the data-table
 *    header rows and the `.links a` chips. Every `button`, `.panel` and `.why`
 *    is a `linear-gradient`, and `html, body` is two `radial-gradient` washes
 *    over `var(--bg)`. axe resolves none of them and files them under
 *    `incomplete`, so a violations-only gate measured the contrast of almost
 *    nothing this lab paints.
 *  - text faded by an ancestor's `opacity` — axe reads the declared `color`,
 *    which is not the colour that lands on screen. This lab has two such
 *    rules: `.cl-hero-sub { opacity: .85 }` and the `opacity: .7` on a
 *    busy/disabled run button (which 1.4.3 exempts as inactive, and `inactive`
 *    below honours).
 *
 * So: walk every element that owns text, composite the real painted result
 * (translucent colours, gradient stops and opacity groups included), and
 * compute the ratio against the surface the text is genuinely sitting on
 * rather than against white. A gradient is judged at the text's own location.
 *
 * Opacity is modelled the way the compositor actually does it: an element with
 * `opacity < 1` renders its subtree into a group, then composites the group
 * over the backdrop. That means the *text* and the *background beside it* fade
 * onto the same backdrop independently — which is why both are carried through
 * the walk as a pair rather than fading the foreground alone. Nothing here
 * fades an own-filled box today, but the model is kept exact so the first
 * faded panel added is measured the way the compositor paints it.
 *
 * The ancestor walk is geometry-aware, because DOM ancestry is not the same
 * thing as "painted underneath". An absolutely positioned child can render
 * entirely outside its parent's box, and then the parent's background is simply
 * not behind it. So an ancestor's own paint is applied only when its border box
 * actually intersects the text's box; a partial intersection still counts, so
 * the judgement stays worst-case. Opacity is unconditional either way — an
 * opacity group fades its whole subtree wherever that subtree happens to paint.
 *
 * Three things this lab forced on top of that, each of which otherwise makes
 * the helper report a ratio nothing on screen has:
 *
 *  - TEXT SCROLLED OUT OF A CLIPPING ANCESTOR PAINTS NOTHING. Here the clipping
 *    boxes are the two `white-space: pre` source listings (`.code-compare pre`,
 *    `overflow-x: auto` — a 403px `<code>` at a 380px viewport genuinely hangs
 *    past the frame), the four-mode `.board` (`overflow-x: auto`) and the two
 *    `.chart-data` disclosures holding the measured-data tables.
 *    Content scrolled past any of them is not dimmed or partly drawn — it is absent,
 *    and asking what colour it sits on has no answer. Its rect is outside every
 *    ancestor's box, so the ancestor walk would find nothing behind it and fall
 *    through to white, inventing a failure. Skip it, and rely on the content
 *    that IS in view, which is measured for real.
 *
 *  - TRANSPARENT TEXT PAINTS NOTHING. Anything drawn `color: transparent` lays
 *    no ink down; compositing a zero-alpha foreground just returns the backdrop
 *    and reports a fixed 1:1. There is no contrast requirement on ink that is
 *    never laid down.
 *
 *  - SVG PAINTS IN DOCUMENT ORDER, SO SIBLINGS CAN BE THE BACKGROUND. This lab
 *    draws both charts into `<canvas>`, and the recovery strip is a CSS flex
 *    row of `<span>` slots, so the sibling walk finds nothing to do. Its
 *    only SVG is the shared top bar's two `aria-hidden` marks. The branch is
 *    kept because the alternative is a helper that silently mismeasures the
 *    first labelled diagram anyone adds: an ancestor-only walk would composite a
 *    `<text>` onto the `<svg>`'s own transparent background rather than onto the
 *    `<rect>` drawn under it, and report a ratio nothing on screen has.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS WALK CANNOT SEE, stated so they are not mistaken for coverage.
 *
 * GENERATED CONTENT. The walk iterates ELEMENTS, and a `::before`/`::after` is
 * not one — nor is it one to axe's `color-contrast` rule. This lab's stylesheet
 * declares NO `content:` rule at all — its non-colour cues (the ⚠ / ✓ / •
 * verdict icons, the ✓/✗ diff classes' glyphs) are real text nodes this walk
 * DOES measure. `nontext.ts` still audits pseudo-content at every driven state,
 * so the first `::after` glyph anyone adds is gated rather than invisible.
 *
 * CANVAS PIXELS. Both charts (`#s2-sweep-canvas`, `#s3-canvas`) are `<canvas>`,
 * and nothing in either oracle can read a pixel a 2D context painted. Each is a
 * duplicate of data also rendered as real text: the sweep numbers live in the
 * `.chart-data` table the gate opens and measures, and the candidate bars'
 * top-4 costs are printed as the `.why-top` list plus the per-position table —
 * but the chart ink itself is outside both oracles and is stated here rather
 * than left to be assumed covered.

 * progress bar's width transition, both cancelled by `main.css`'s
 * reduced-motion block, and `ui.ts` additionally reads
 * `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` and drops the 70ms
 * per-position pause of the attack animation — so under the reduced motion the
 * gate asserts, every scanned state is the settled end state.
 *
 * The parameter is kept because the narrowed form is what makes a short-lived
 * state measurable at all: a class that lives 500ms is shorter than a full axe
 * pass, so a whole-page scan would catch it only sometimes, and a
 * sometimes-measured assertion is worse than none.

     *    so far: …"), so exposing twelve individual character spans underneath
     *    it would read the label and then spell the secret one glyph at a time.
     *    Hand-measured in both themes: an unfilled slot is `--muted` on
     *    `--chart-surface` (≈7.0:1 light, ≈9:1 dark) and a filled slot is
     *    `--on-accent` on `--accent` (#fff on #b45309 ≈5.0:1 light, #241400 on
     *    #f5b14c ≈9.6:1 dark) — all clear of 4.5:1.
     *
     * The only other `aria-hidden` on the page is on the shared top bar's two
     * decorative SVG marks. Nothing here hides a VALUE: no verdict, no summary,

     * parent whose border box does not overlap the text paints nothing behind
     * it. Applied to the ROOT it is wrong, and wrong in the direction that
     * FABRICATES failures. CSS propagates the root element's background to the
     * canvas and paints it over the whole canvas regardless of the root's own
     * box (CSS Backgrounds 3, "The Canvas Background"); if the root's own
     * background is transparent the value is taken from `<body>` instead.
     *
     * The failure this prevents is not hypothetical — it cost a run elsewhere in
     * this fleet. A lab that sets `html, body { height: 100% }` has both boxes
     * exactly one viewport tall while the document runs several viewports long,
     * so every element below the fold intersects neither, the walk ends with a
     * transparent backdrop, and it falls through to WHITE. In a dark theme that
     * reports muted footer text against a white page that does not exist — 34 of
     * 38 findings in one run elsewhere in this fleet — and it can mask a real
     * failure in the other direction just as easily.
     *
     * It is NOT a no-op on this page. `styles/main.css` paints the canvas with
     * a three-layer `background` on `html, body` — two `radial-gradient` washes
     * over `var(--bg)` — and gives both boxes only `min-height: 100%`, so on a
     * five-section document many screens deep the root's own border box ends
     * long before the content does. Without the propagation rule below, every
     * element past the first screen would find no ancestor paint at all and fall
     * through to WHITE, which in the dark theme (`--bg: #1c1a16`) reports
     * near-white ink
     * on a page that does not exist. Reading `backgroundColor` alone would be
     * just as wrong here: it is `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` on both boxes, because the
     * colour is the last layer of the shorthand and only `paintAt` composites it.
